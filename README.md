## 💡 How It Works

1. **MathJax Rendering**  
   The LaTeX code inside the editor is wrapped with `$$ ... $$` and rendered by MathJax 3 in real time.

2. **Symbol Buttons**  
   Each button injects a LaTeX snippet into the textarea at the cursor position.

3. **Local Storage**  
   Equations can be saved in the browser’s `localStorage` (up to 10 equations).
